            <h5>Favorite Shows</h5>
            <p>Currently, my favorite show is Survivor! I have been binge watching all of the past seasons and love the gameplay and strategy that the shows brings out in people! I personally could never go on the show as I would quite literally get eaten alive by bugs. I also love watching Grey's Anatomy. I have watched the entire show (all 18 seasons) about 3 times!</p>
